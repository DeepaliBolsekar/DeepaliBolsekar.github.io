I'm an IT graduate with a passion for cybersecurity so intense, it might be classified as a security threat! üõ°Ô∏èüíª When I'm not battling malware or dissecting phishing emails, I'm either deep in a good book or folding origami masterpieces. üìöü¶¢ My journey in cybersecurity has been a wild ride, filled with internships, CEH training, and countless hours of hands-on practice. I'm always learning, always growing, and always ready to help others navigate the digital jungle. So, if you're looking for a SOC analyst who can tackle anything from malware to origami, look no furth
