A ticketing system, also known as a help desk or issue tracking system, is a software application that facilitates the management and resolution of customer support requests or incidents. It provides a centralized platform for customers to submit their queries, concerns, or problems, and for support teams to address and resolve them efficiently.

## **Why do we need a ticketing system?**

- **Organization and Prioritization:** Ticketing systems help organize and prioritize support requests, preventing them from falling through the cracks. They provide a structured way to track and manage incoming requests, ensuring that they are addressed in a timely and efficient manner.
- **Improved Efficiency:** By assigning tickets to specific agents or teams based on their expertise and availability, ticketing systems can improve the efficiency of support operations. This helps to reduce response times and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Enhanced Communication and Collaboration:** Ticketing systems provide a centralized platform for communication between customers and support agents. They facilitate collaboration among team members and ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the status of support requests.
- **Knowledge Base and Self-Service:** Many ticketing systems include a knowledge base or FAQ section where customers can find answers to common questions and troubleshoot issues on their own. This can reduce the workload on support teams and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Ticketing systems provide valuable insights into support operations through detailed reporting and analytics. This information can be used to identify trends, measure performance, and improve customer service processes.
